# **`basemath`**

Instead of continuing to duplicate math functions in every math project I make, why not have a Rust library that I can import at any time?

Basemath takes advantage of Rust's trait system to allow for plenty of mathematical functions implemented from the ground up (trigonometry, inverse trigonometry, polynomial solving, complex numbers and quaternions, rational numbers, exponentials and logarithms, etc) on several datatypes, and even your own datatypes!
